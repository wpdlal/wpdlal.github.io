          Happy Monthsary wabi! ðŸ’•<br /><br />
          hii baby! 23 months na tayo!! lapit na 2 years hehehe we still staying strong right?
          Ik that we are having a rough time these past few days and it's nothing like our other
          challenges. This obstacle is quite big for us, it's making you tired, making you feel 
          so helpless. Still we can do it right!! I am with you darling so you are not alone hm? 
          You don't have to be scared, we can smash this big obstacle in front of us and have our 
          happy ending. Ik that i am asking so much from you but just this one baby hm? after this
          you can have me na. I'm sorry about this baba. Ik you are hiding it from me so i won't 
          feel guilty, but i can see po na you are hurting so much and so close to giving up hon. 
          I am giving you all of my promises. You can trust me baby. You don't have to love me all
          the time. You don't have to think about me all the time, but i promise you that i will
          always go home to you and that i'll give you my everything to make you fall in love with me
          again. 23 months is so long baby and ik that loving me is not that easy. i am sensitive, 
          stubborn, makulit, lahat na ng nakakainis asa akin na yet you still choose to love me 
          patiently and choose me everyday. I hope that i won't witness you really giving up on us, 
          but even if you do i won't let go of you. I'll hold you until you are ready again to hold 
          my hand and fulfill our dreams with me. You made my life so much easier baby. You are the 
          reason why even if i really want to give up i choose to fight so i can see your beautiful 
          face. You really brought so much light to my life. I never thought i'd have someone who 
          would support me in everything that i do, who could make me feel super loved, who could 
          understand me so much. Thank you baby for being patient with me and staying even if 
          things weren't easy. ik that yk that you are not just my girlfriend, you are my bestfriend, 
          my home, my safe place, my partner in everything. I am so proud of how far we've come and 
          i am looking forward to the future that we've planned. let's overcome this challenge together 
          hm? walang Iwanan ah! diba! hawak kamay! I love you my moonpie!
